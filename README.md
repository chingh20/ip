Welcome to Duke! 
Have you ever forgotten a deadline for homework or missed a test because you thought it was supposed to be on another day?
If `haveExperiencedAboved == true`, Duke is here to save you!


## The ultimate todo list ðŸ˜„
Duke helps you keep track of your tasks and deadlines! Your tasks are put into a todo list and ultimately saved to a *file.txt* file on your device, so your list won't be gone even if you exit Duke! 
Here are several functions of Duke and commands you can use:
* See what is in your todo list:
   * **list**
* Add a task to your list:
   * **todo** **task description**
   * **event** *task description* **/at** *time description*
   * **deadline** *task description* **/by** *time description*
* Delete a task from your list:
   * **delete** *task number*
* Mark a task as done:
   * **done** *task number*
* Close Duke:
   * **bye**
